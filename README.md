# CST-221

Hello my name is Tim James. I am currently attending Grand Canyon University to obtain a bachelors in computer programming. This is my second year at GCU and I have really enjoyed the classes I have taken so far. I am decent in the Java programming language and have had some minor experience in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and C. I look forward to increasing my skills in the C language throughout this CST-221 course.
